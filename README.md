# COVID19-rates-and-cases visualizations

## Introduction 
The following two maps are primarily focused on visualizing COVID19 rates and counts in the United States during the year of 2020. 

In the [first map](https://github.com/elilsan/COVID19-rates-and-cases/blob/54edcee3c826642ec410fe427dda0cc58999365f/map1.html), we can see that COVID19 rates are being visualized based on counties, and not necessarily states. Categorizing the data rate by county makes it easier to see exactly which areas are reported to have higher rates of COVID19 infections. In addition, it would be confusing to the viewer if the data were to be categorized by state.

In the [second map](https://github.com/elilsan/COVID19-rates-and-cases/blob/0f4d77634b6281244e2deff5ecd351c9e3dcb1b6/map2.html), the COVID19 counts were visualized with proportional symbols. This made the counts easier to see for the viewer because in this way, we can see were more people were infected and where there could be clusters.
